/*
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of
(the number of variable-length arrays) and (the number of queries).
Each line of the subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the -element array located at .
Each of the subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of (an index in array ) and (an index in the array referenced by

) for a query.

Constraints

All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than

Output Format

For each pair of
and values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index of the array referenced by . There should be a total of

lines of output.
